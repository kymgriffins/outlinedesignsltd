  - `project.ts`, `blogs.ts`: Pinia stores for data grids and selection
- `_mockApis/`
  - `projects/ProjectsData.ts`, `blogs/blogsData.ts`, `mockAdapter.ts`, `index.ts`
  - Provides mock endpoints consumed by Axios (e.g., `/api/data/projects/grid`)
- `plugins/vuetify.ts`
  - Registers Vuetify, imports global styles, themes, and mock APIs
- `theme/`
  - `LightTheme.ts`, `DarkTheme.ts`
- `utils/axios.ts`

### Data flow
1. Mock APIs are registered on app startup (`plugins/vuetify.ts` imports `_mockApis`), wiring axios-mock-adapter.
2. Pinia stores call Axios endpoints (`/api/data/projects/grid`, `/api/data/blog/grid`, etc.).
3. Components consume store state to render grids, details, and homepage sections.

### Theming
- Default theme: `LIGHT_THEME` (configured in `plugins/vuetify.ts`).
- Toggle available in layout header component, switching between `LIGHT_THEME` and `DARK_THEME`.

### Run locally
```bash
pnpm install        # or: npm install / yarn install
pnpm dev            # or: npm run dev / yarn dev
```

### Build and preview
```bash
pnpm build          # or: npm run build / yarn build
pnpm preview        # or: npm run preview / yarn preview
```

### Deployment notes
- SSR is disabled (`ssr: false` in `nuxt.config.ts`), so the app runs as an SPA.
- Nitro `serveStatic: true` is enabled; you can host the generated output on static hosts.
- For traditional hosting, serve via any Node-compatible environment using `nuxt build` + `nuxt preview` or your own server.

### Customization guide
- Branding
  - Replace logos in `public/images/logos/*` and favicon in `public/favicon.ico`.
- Colors & typography
  - Adjust Vuetify theme tokens in `theme/LightTheme.ts` and `theme/DarkTheme.ts`.
- Homepage sections
  - Tweak or reorder sections in `pages/index.vue` and `components/Homepage/*`.
- Content sources
  - Update mock data in `_mockApis/*` or connect to a real API by replacing the mock adapter with actual endpoints in `utils/axios.ts`.
- SEO title
  - Edit `app.head.title` in `nuxt.config.ts`.
